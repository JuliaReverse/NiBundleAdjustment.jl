# NiBundleAdjustment

Generate Jacobians for Bundle Adjustment application with NiLang and ForwardDiff.

The motivation is to beat the benchmark in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10129), for the glory of Julia community!

## Get started!

Open a Julia REPL and type `]` to enter `pkg` mode and then type
```julia pkg
pkg> dev git@github.com:JuliaReverse/NiBundleAdjustment.jl.git
pkg> add ForwardDiff BenchmarkTools StaticArrays
```

Then in a bash shell, type the following commands to open the benchmark file in Atom.
```bash
$ julia ~/.julia/dev/NiBundleAdjustment/benchmarks/benchmark.jl
```

You will see results like:
```julia repl

We see our ForwardDiff result is 16x faster than the original version, it still has some room for optimization as can be seen from the allocations in our benchmark.
NiLang is even faster. Here the Jacobian is computed by glueing the Jacobians of a function with 15 input parameters and 2 output parameters. This is why NiLang does not have much advantage comparing with forward mode AD.
